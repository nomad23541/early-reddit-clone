# early-reddit-clone

Built using NodeJS and Express. Learned authentication and interacting with mongodb in this project.

Users can create and sign into their profiles, when logged in they can post links to the "Front Page" (hence kinda like reddit). Users can visit their own profile and remove posts they've submitted.
